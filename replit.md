# CSS Button Maker

## Overview

This is a React-based CSS button maker application that allows users to create custom gradient buttons with live preview and CSS code generation. The application features a modern, interactive interface built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, using shadcn/ui components for the user interface. Users can design buttons with separate gradient controls for borders, text, and backgrounds, plus 3D effects and precise sizing controls.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useCallback) for local component state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling via shadcn/ui

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **API Design**: RESTful API structure with Express routes

### Development Setup
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite HMR for frontend, tsx for backend development
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across frontend, backend, and shared modules
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configuration with TypeScript support

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **GradientButton**: Main button component that renders the customizable gradient button
2. **ColorPicker**: Color selection interface for gradient colors
3. **CSSOutput**: Displays generated CSS code with copy/download functionality
4. **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library including:
   - Form controls (Input, Select, Slider, Button)
   - Layout components (Card, Dialog, Tabs)
   - Feedback components (Toast, Tooltip)

### Backend Components
1. **Express Server**: Main application server with middleware setup
2. **Route Handler**: Centralized route registration system
3. **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation
4. **Database Schema**: Drizzle ORM schema definitions for PostgreSQL

### Shared Components
1. **Schema Definitions**: Shared TypeScript types and Zod validation schemas
2. **Database Models**: User model with insert/select type definitions

## Data Flow

### Client-Side State Management
- Button configuration state managed locally in the GradientDesigner component
- Real-time updates trigger re-renders of the preview button
- CSS generation happens on-demand based on current state
- Toast notifications for user feedback on actions

### Server-Side Data Flow
- Express middleware handles request logging and JSON parsing
- Routes are registered through a centralized system
- Database operations abstracted through storage interface
- Session management handled via PostgreSQL store

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite bundles React application for production
- Backend: esbuild compiles TypeScript server code
- Static assets served from dist/public directory
- Development: Vite dev server with HMR integration

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Router (Wouter)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Utilities**: clsx for conditional classes, date-fns for date handling

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless driver
- **Session Management**: express-session with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, nodemon-like functionality

### Development Tools
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild, TypeScript compiler
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **CSS Processing**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
1. Frontend assets compiled and optimized by Vite
2. Backend code bundled with esbuild for Node.js runtime
3. Static files served from Express server
4. Database migrations applied via Drizzle Kit

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- Session store configured for PostgreSQL
- Production-ready Express server configuration

### Development Workflow
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Integrated development server with Vite middleware
